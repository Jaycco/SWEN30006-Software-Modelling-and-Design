## Project 1
- You and your team of independent Software Contractors, have been hired by Robotic Mailing Solutions Inc.
(RMS) to provide some much needed assistance in delivering the latest version of their product Automail
to market. The Automail is an automated mail sorting and delivery system designed to operate in large
buildings that have dedicated Mail rooms. It offers end to end receipt and delivery of mail items within
the building, and can be tweaked to fit many different installation environments.
