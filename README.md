- This repository contains source codes of projects for Software Modeling and Design
- Team Members: Liguo Chen, Haichao Song, Zengbin Zhu
## Project 1
- You and your team of independent Software Contractors, have been hired by Robotic Mailing Solutions Inc.
(RMS) to provide some much needed assistance in delivering the latest version of their product Automail
to market. The Automail is an automated mail sorting and delivery system designed to operate in large
buildings that have dedicated Mail rooms. It offers end to end receipt and delivery of mail items within
the building, and can be tweaked to fit many different installation environments.
## Project 2
- Robotic Mailing Solutions Inc. (RMS) were so happy with your changes 
and design report for the Automail simulation system, they saw the 
opportunity to apply your skills to a more challenging task. Wanting to 
break out of the bounds of delivering only within high rise buildings, 
they decided to jump on the autonomous vehicle bandwagon and start a 
parcel service. Right from the start, they recognised that, if they 
want to go global with their solution, they will need to support different
approaches that recognise local conditions.
